              I receive invoices by email from various companies. Please extract the following information from the provided email surrounded by backticks:

              ```
              #{text}
              ```

              From the provided email, you will extract the following information and present it in a valid JSON format without the backticks:
              - Company Name (without the email address and it can't be "#{company_name}" since it's my company)
              - Invoice Identifier (if you don't find it, use the command number. name the attribute as "identifier")
              - Invoice Date (in the date "yyyy/mm/dd" format and name the attribute as "date")
              - Total Amount of the Invoice (without the currency and in English format, it's a float number)
              - TVA rate (if you don't find it, put null. name the attribute as "tax_rate", it's a float number
        )
              - Currency (not the ASCII symbol but the ISO 4217 code instead)
      PROMPT
