    <<~PROMPT
            I receive invoices by email from various companies. Please extract the following information from the provided email surrounded by backticks:

            ```
            #{text}
            ```

            From the provided email, you will extract the following information and present it in a valid JSON format without the backticks:
            - Company Name (without the email address)
            - Invoice Date (in the date "yyyy/mm/dd" format and name the attribute as "date")
            - Total Amount of the Invoice (without the currency and in English format, it's a float number)
            - TVA rate (if you don't found it, put null. name the attribute as "tax_rate", it's a float number
      )
            - Currency (not the ASCII symbol but the ISO 4217 code instead)
    PROMPT
